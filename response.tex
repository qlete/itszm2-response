\section*{Organization}

This document develops our responses to the observations and comments raised by the reviewers of our original manuscript ``Impacts of Transmission Switching in Zonal Electricity Markets - Part II'' in the secound round. The document also explains modifications to the manuscript that were inspired by the comments of the reviewers.

The document is organized into 2 sections, each of which corresponds to a different reviewer. We present reviewers' comments in black font and our responses using indented \textcolor{blue}{blue} paragraphs. Modifications to the manuscript are highlighted in \textcolor{blue}{blue} and, occasionally, repeated for convenience in the present document in indented italic \textcolor{red}{red} paragraphs.

\section{Reviewer \#1:}
My comments from Part II echo my concerns from Part I. They are only briefly described below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The paper appears to contradict itself on whether the day-ahead model includes unit commitment or not.
    \item Do the theoretical results of Part I hold if unit commitment is included in the day-ahead model?
    \item The authors do not clearly describe how prices are generated in their "zonal day-ahead model."
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reviewer \#2:}
The authors addressed in a satisfactory way my prior major concern regarding the N-1 security rule. I have no further comment.

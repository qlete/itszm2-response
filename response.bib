The model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program with uncertain wind production in various locations of the network as well as generator and transmission line failures. We present a scenario selection algorithm for selecting and weighing wind power production scenarios and composite element failures, and we provide a parallel dual decomposition algorithm for solving the resulting mixed-integer program. We validate the proposed scenario selection algorithm by demonstrating that it outperforms alternative reserve commitment approaches in a 225 bus model of California with 130 generators and 375 transmission lines. We use our model to quantify day-ahead generator capacity commitment, operating cost impacts, and renewable energy utilization levels for various degrees of wind power integration. We then demonstrate that failing to account for transmission constraints and contingencies can result in significant errors in assessing the economic impacts of renewable energy integration. }

    abstract={We formulate a series of stochastic models for committing and dispatching electric generators subject to transmission limits. The models are used to estimate the benefits of electricity locational marginal pricing (LMP) that arise from better coordination of day-ahead commitment decisions and real-time balancing markets in adjacent power markets when there is significant uncertainty in demand and wind forecasts. The unit commitment models optimise schedules under either the full set of network constraints or a simplified net transfer capacity (NTC) constraint, considering the range of possible real-time wind and load scenarios. The NTC-constrained model represents the present approach for limiting day-ahead electricity trade in Europe. A subsequent redispatch model then creates feasible real-time schedules. Benefits of LMP arise from decreases in expected start-up and variable generation costs resulting from consistent consideration of the full set of network constraints both day-ahead and in real-time. Meanwhile, using LMP to coordinate adjacent balancing markets provides benefits because it allows intermarket flow schedules to be adjusted in real-time in response to changing conditions. These models are applied to a stylised four-node network, examining the effects of varying system characteristics on the magnitude of the locational-based unit commitment benefits and the benefits of intermarket balancing. Although previous www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk EPRG WORKING PAPER studies have examined the benefits of LMP, these usually examine one specific system, often without a discussion of the sources of these benefits, and with simplifying assumptions about unit commitment. We conclude that both categories of benefits are situation dependent, such that small parameter changes can lead to large changes in expected benefits. Although both can amount to a significant percentage of operating costs, we find that the benefits of balancing market coordination are generally larger},

  abstract={Flexibility is becoming an increasingly important attribute of conventional generators due to the challenges imposed by the unpredictable, highly variable and non-controllable nature of renewable supply. Paradoxically, flexible units are currently being mothballed or retired in Europe due to financial losses. We investigate an energy-only market design, referred to as operating reserve demand curves, that rewards flexibility by adjusting the real-time energy price to a level that reflects the value of capacity under conditions of scarcity. We test the performance of the mechanism by developing a model of the Belgian electricity market, which is validated against the historical outcomes of the market over a study period of 21 months. We verify that (i) based on the observed market outcomes of our study period, none of the existing combined cycle gas turbines of the Belgian market can cover their investment costs, and (ii) the introduction of price adders that reflect the true value of scarce flexible capacity restores economic viability for most combined cycle gas turbines in the Belgian market.},

A contract network option provides an internally consistent framework for assigning long-term capacity rights to a complicated electric transmission network. The contract network respects the special conditions induced by Kirchoff's Laws; accommodates thermal, voltage, and contingency constraints on transmission capacity; and can be adopted without disturbing existing methods for achieving an economic power dispatch subject to these constraints. By design, a contract network would maintain short-run efficiency through optimal spot-price determination of transmission prices. Through payment of congestion rentals, the contract network makes a long-term capacity-right holder indifferent between delivery of the power or receipt of payments in a settlement system.

Using small network examples we illustrate the difficulties involved in defining the zones, the redistribution effects of the surplus that a zonal pricing system has, as well as the conflicting interests concerning zone boundaries that are present among the various market participants. We also show that a zone allocation mechanism based on nodal prices does not necessarily lead to a zone system with maximal social surplus. Finally, we formulate an optimization model that when solved yields the zone system that maximizes social surplus given a pre-specification of the number of zones to be used.},

  abstract={This paper extends a recent analysis which investigated the impact of scarcity adders produced by operating reserve demand curves on the financial viability of generation units in the Belgian market. Our paper is inspired by practical considerations related to the implementation of the mechanism in European electricity markets. We are specifically interested in: (i) the extent to which the mechanism rewards flexible resources for being available 'when and where' needed, as required by European competition law; (ii) the sensitivity of the mechanism to certain parameters that require regulatory judgment; (iii) the interaction of the mechanism with indirect capacity mechanisms; and (iv) the ability of the mechanism to provide long-term investment signals. We find that the restoration of nuclear capacity in the Belgian market would suppress scarcity adders to near-zero values. We show that the increase in value of lost load would have a minor impact on scarcity adders when capacity shortages are negligible. We find that the removal of strategic reserve from the Belgian market would have a significant impact on scarcity adders. We find strong positive correlation in consecutive imbalance increments, and show that this correlation can result in noticeable impact on the computation of scarcity adders. We demonstrate that the back-propagation of scarcity adders is essential for providing a long-term investment signal to flexible resources.},

  abstract={We consider the optimization problem implementing current market rules for European day-ahead electricity markets. We propose improved algorithmic approaches for that problem. First, a new MIP formulation is presented which avoids the use of complementarity constraints to express market equilibrium conditions, and also avoids the introduction of auxiliary continuous or binary variables. Instead, we rely on strong duality theory for linear or convex quadratic optimization problems to recover equilibrium constraints. When so-called stepwise bid curves are considered to describe continuous bids, the new formulation allows to take full advantage of state-of-the-art MILP solvers, and in most cases, an optimal solution including market prices can be computed for large-scale instances without any further algorithmic work. Second, the new formulation suggests a Benders-like decomposition procedure. This helps in the case of piecewise linear bid curves that yield quadratic primal and dual objective functions leading to a dense quadratic constraint in the formulation. This procedure essentially strengthens classical Benders cuts locally. Computational experiments using 2011 historical instances for the Central Western Europe region show excellent results. In the linear case, both approaches are very efficient, while for quadratic instances, only the decomposition procedure is appropriate. Finally, when most orders are block orders, and instances are combinatorially very hard, the direct MILP approach is substantially more efficient.},

Electric power markets in which nonconvexities arise from the operating characteristics of generators motivate our analysis; however, the results presented here are general and can be applied to other markets in which nonconvexities are important. We show that the optimal solution to a linear program that solves the mixed integer program has dual variables that: (1) have the traditional economic interpretation as prices; (2) explicitly price integral activities; and (3) clear the market in the presence of nonconvexities. We then show how this methodology can be used to interpret the solutions to nonconvex problems such as the problem discussed by Scarf [Journal of Economic Perspectives 8(4) (1994) 111].},
